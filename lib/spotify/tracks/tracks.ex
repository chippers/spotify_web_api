    The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part,
    on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.

    popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past.

    independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from
    track popularity. Note that the popularity value may lag actual popularity
